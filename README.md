# Interactive Web Visualizations Challenge
For this project we created an interactive dashboard on a website that plotted several points of dataset. Page linked here: 

In building this dashboard, we've created individual plots that all get updated utilizing a drop down menu.  

# Files
Requirements for the website to run:
html file for the website
